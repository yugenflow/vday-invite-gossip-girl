Subject Overview: Olympic 10m Air Rifle Shooter
Voxel/Roblox Aesthetic Note: The key characteristic of this outfit is stiffness. Shooting suits are made of thick, rigid canvas and leather to support the shooter's body. In a voxel style, this should translate to "blocky" silhouettes with very little fabric draping or folding. The character should look almost armored.

1. The Outfit (Shooting Suit)
Head & Accessories

Visor: A black, open-top sun visor with a curved brim.

Eyewear: (Optional) Shooting glasses with a blinder on the non-aiming eye.

Gloves: A black, fingerless or padded shooting glove on the support hand (left hand for a right-handed shooter). The trigger hand is usually bare.

Torso: The Shooting Jacket

Material Appearance: Thick, heavy canvas and leather. It holds its shape rigidly.

Front Design:

Asymmetry: The design is asymmetrical.

Colors: Primarily White and Red with Black accents.

Fasteners: A vertical row of 4-5 large, silver/grey buttons runs down the front, slightly offset to the right side.

Patches: A large, black, textured grip patch on the right shoulder (where the rifle butt rests) and black patches on the elbows.

Back Design:

Base: White leather/canvas.

Color Block: A large angular Red panel covers the lower right back.

Straps (Crucial Detail): A distinctive black vertical strip runs down the center of the spine containing multiple silver horizontal buckles or grommets (used for tightening the jacket).

Text: Black letters "KYA" (or similar block text) on the lower left tail of the jacket.

Legs: The Shooting Trousers

Shape: Straight-legged, wide, and stiff. They do not crumple like jeans; they look like rigid tubes.

Color Blocking:

Top Block (Waist to Hips): White.

Main Leg: Bright Red.

Knees: Large, rectangular Black pads on both knees (vented or textured rubber appearance).

Crotch: A black triangular flexible panel at the inner thigh.

Belt: A thick Red belt with a flat rectangular buckle.

Back of Pants: Zippers running down the back of the legs (often visible as black lines in voxel art).

Feet

Boots: Flat-soled shooting boots. Black leather, ankle-high, very flat bottom for stability. No heel drop.

2. The Rifle (Precision Air Rifle)
Model Identification: This appears to be a Walther LG400 (or similar high-end match air rifle).

Stock: An aluminum chassis, highly skeletal and mechanical.

Color: Silver/Metallic Grey aluminum body with Black carbon fiber accents.

Barrel & Cylinder:

Main Barrel: A long, sleek silver barrel, possibly with a carbon fiber sleeve (patterned black/grey).

Air Cylinder: A thick, silver cylinder mounted directly underneath the barrel (this is the compressed air tank).

Rear Assembly (Buttstock):

Very complex and mechanical. It is not a solid piece of wood. It consists of adjustable metal rods, a cheek piece (black), and a buttplate (metal with rubber grip) that fits into the shoulder.

Sights:

Rear Sight: A complex "diopter" sight (a small black boxy unit) mounted near the shooter's eye.

Front Sight: A tunnel sight (a small black ring/tube) at the very end of the barrel.
