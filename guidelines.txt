These are the shooting range guidelines:

This shooting range was designed by Prateek, there are a few guidelines that one must adhere to and keep in mind before using. These guidelines were thought of after great pondering so make sure you read them and stick to them:

1. You can only use the shooting range if your name fits within the letters N _ _ _ A K _ _ _ _ I
2. You should be a 10 with a record of hitting's 10s on other ranges
3. Share a mutual sense of admiration for good onion rings 
4. Be open to receiving peonies on the 14th February
5. Have a great face card (sorry this range is discriminatory that way :)
6. You must hit 3 "Yes" targets to confirm your answer — no half measures allowed!
7. On every successful shot, a notification is sent to me via telegram. You are free to explore this world as you want.

Lastly, I hope you nail the shots just like you do irl!! Enjoy :D

Note: If any of the above criteria are not met and you're found shooting at the range, it can lead to dire consequences.
