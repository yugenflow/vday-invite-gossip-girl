GOSSIP GIRL BLAST

Good evening, Upper East Siders. Gossip Girl here — your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.

Spotted: A certain Cutakshita entering a private fashion studio on the Upper East Side. Word on the street is she's been personally invited to walk the runway tonight. But here's the twist...

The Rules of the Runway:

1. Only those whose name fits A _ _ _ _ T _ S _ _ _ _ A may walk this runway
2. Must have the face card that never declines — sorry, this is the Upper East Side
3. Must appreciate a good Tres Leches as well as Prince Paan Chaat
4. Strike 3 poses on the GOLD spots to confirm your answer — half measures are SO last season
5. The RED spots? Those are for the nobodies. A queen knows where to pose.
6. Every pose sends a notification straight to a certain someone's phone. You're being watched, darling.
7. Feel free to explore — after all, the Upper East Side is yours tonight.

And remember, Cutakshita: on this runway, there are no wrong answers... only fabulous ones.

XOXO, you know you love me.

Note: Gossip Girl takes no responsibility for broken hearts, stolen glances, or Valentine's Day plans that may result from this experience.
